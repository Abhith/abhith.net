In my 6 years of software engineer career, following are the questions which I faced (don't remember all of them). 

- [Self-introduction (3)](#self-introduction)
- [Difference between WCF and Web API](#difference-between-wcf-and-web-api)
- [Delegates](#delegates )

Noticed the count beside some questions?
It indicates that the question were asked on multiple occasions.

No matter what kind of interview you are going to attend, prepare for this question. 
### <a name="difference-between-wcf-and-web-api"></a> Difference between WCF and Web API
- WCF enables building services that support multiple transport protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP, and custom transports) and allows switching between them.
- Web API is HTTP only. First-class programming model for HTTP. More suitable for access from various browsers, mobile devices etc enabling wide reach.
- WCF enables building services that support multiple encodings (Text, MTOM, and Binary) of the same message type and allows switching between them.
- Web API support wide variety of media types including XML, JSON etc.
- WCF supports building services with WS-* standards like Reliable Messaging, Transactions, Message Security.
- Web API uses basic protocol and formats such as HTTP, WebSockets, SSL, JSON, and XML. There is no support for higher level protocols such as Reliable Messaging or Transactions.
- WCF supports Request-Reply, One Way, and Duplex message exchange patterns.
- HTTP is request/response but additional patterns can be supported through SignalR and WebSockets integration with Web API.
- WCF SOAP services can be described in WSDL allowing automated tools to generate client proxies even for services with complex schemas.
- There is a variety of ways to describe a Web API ranging from auto-generated HTML help page (eg. Swagger) describing snippets to structured metadata for OData integrated APIs.
- WCF ships with the .NET framework.
- Web API ships with .NET framework but is open-source and is also available out-of-band as independent download.

### <a name="delegates"></a> Delegates
A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type.
- Delegates allow methods to be passed as parameters.
- Delegates can be used to define callback methods. 
- Delegates can be chained together.
