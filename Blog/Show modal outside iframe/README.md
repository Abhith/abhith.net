[Socialboard.io](https://socialboard.io) is one of the projects am working in. Which is a social feed aggregator and provides integration to other websites via Iframe.

The problem was when we integrate via iframe, the modal will not be stretched out to the parent, it will only be shown inside the iframe and s it looks ugly.

So we had to find a solution.

The solution I came up with was to consume "window.postMessage()".

window.postMessage()

There is a well-written post about window.postMessage() in the MDN, link attached at the end of this article.

 

 

Read more about window.postMessage() [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).
