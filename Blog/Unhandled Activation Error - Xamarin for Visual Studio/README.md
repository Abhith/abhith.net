Xamarin account login error on visual studio : Could not load machine data.

I have a side project, [piggyvault](http://piggyvault.in) aka piggy, which is basically my personal finance management app. Have a web application for the same as well as a mobile app built using Ionic, specifically Ionic 3.

First did it on Ionic 1, then upgraded to 2 and now it is running on Ionic 3. People have a tendency to get bored, so when I get bored I tried to build an app for my piggy using Xamarin.

Initially tried Xamarin.Android, it was tough though. I didn't have any previous experience in XAML. Once I completed a CRUD module in Xamarin.Android, found the evolve app built using Xamarin.Forms and I were pretty impressed.

So, stopped Xamarin.Android and cloned evolve app and did implement few of my app features in the Xamarin.Form version and it runs smooth.

But recently I switched my dev machine. And now facing two problems related to Xamarin development.

- First one, the already working solution not building on the new machine,
- ~~Secondly, Couldn't able to sign into my Xamarin account from visual studio 17 preview.~~

And am stuck.

Hoping to find solutions for both.

Hoping is a bad idea.

Trying...

#### Update 1:
I reported the problem to VisualStudio developer community and here is the [link](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/106582/unable-to-sign-in-to-xamarin-account-unhandled-act.html)

#### Update 2: 
I was trying login in VS 2017 Preview 15.4.0 and it wasn't working. After adding the Xamarin related feature pack to my 15.3.3 stable VS 2017, I tried the login in it and it worked. Then checked the login status in VS preview and that was also in the same state as in the stable.
