I have a side project, [piggyvault](http://piggyvault.in) aka piggy, which is basically my personal finance management app. Have a web application for the same as well as a mobile app built using Ionic, specifically Ionic 3.

First did it on Ionic 1, then upgraded to 2 and now it is running on Ionic 3. People have a tendency to get bored, so when I get bored I tried to build an app for my piggy using Xamarin.

Initially tried Xamarin.Android, it was tough though. I didn't have any previous experience in XAML. Once I completed a CRUD module in Xamarin.Android, found the evolve app built using Xamarin.Forms and I were pretty impressed.

So, stopped Xamarin.Android and cloned evolve app and did implement few of my app features in the Xamarin.Form version and it runs smooth.

But recently I switched my dev machine. And now facing two problems related to Xamarin development.

- First one, the already working solution not building on the new machine,
- Secondly, Couldn't able to sign into my Xamarin account from visual studio 17 preview.

And am stuck.

Hoping to find solutions for both.

Hoping is a bad idea, trying is a good idea.

Trying...
