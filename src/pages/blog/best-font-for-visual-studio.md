Unlike the default user, most programmers do care about the font they are using, so do I.

## Mostly Used Fonts

### Fira Code

Monospaced font with programming ligatures.

GitHub: [tonsky/FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

All the instructions to install the font and configuring it in the IDE's including **Visual Studio** and **Visual Studio Code** is documented in the wiki.

### Fantasque Sans Mono

Fantasque Sans Mono is my choice for the past two years. You need to try it to see how good it is.

> A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.

It is also opensource and you can find it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans).  (3k+ stars).

#### How to install new font (windows)

- Download the font from [here](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/releases/latest)
- In the ttf folder, double-click each font file, click “Install font”; to install all at once, select all files, right-click, and choose “Install”.
- Open Visual Studio settings. **Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors** > Choose **Fantasque Sans Mono** from the font
   list > OK.

## Update 1

My favorite is now **Fira Code**

If you have a better suggestion, let me know in the comments.
