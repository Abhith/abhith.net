For the past month, I have been in the search for the best laptop, that will help me to do things faster. Best in the sense which worth every penny and yet strong in specs, not a high-end gaming machine.

### History

Laptops I used earlier are,

- Dell Inspiron (Exact series don't remember)
- HP Pro Book
- Lenovo Y520 (256 SSD)
- Lenovo G40

In the above list, none of them owned by myself, first 3 out of the 4 was given by my ex-company during the employment period and the other is rented out from my brother-in-law. Out of all Lenovo Y520 was my favorite just because of its specs and speed.

### Minimum Requirements

Right now its time to own a machine, and the **minimum** features am looking for are,

1. Thunderbolt 3 support.
2. SSD
3. Intel i7-9750H processor
4. RTX 2060 Graphics card
5. Fingerprint sensor

### Shortlisted Laptops

After watching tons of reviews and all, my shortlisted items are,

#### Acer Predator Triton 500

Model Name: PT515-51-73EG

##### Cons

### Skipped Laptops

#### Lenovo Y740

- Big Charger and small battery.

#### Asus ROG Zephyrus s GX701

### Conclusion
