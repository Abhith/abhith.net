For the past month, I have been in the search for the best laptop, that will help me to do things faster. **Best in the sense which worth every penny and yet strong in specs**, not a high-end gaming machine.

### History

Laptops I used earlier are,

- Dell Inspiron (Exact series don't remember)
- HP Pro Book
- Lenovo Y520 (256 SSD)
- Lenovo G40

In the above list, none of them owned by myself, first 3 out of the 4 was given by my ex-company during the employment period and the other is rented out from my brother-in-law. Out of all Lenovo Y520 was my favorite just because of its specs and speed.

### Minimum Requirements

Right now its time to own a machine, and the **minimum** features am looking for are,

1. Thunderbolt 3 support.
2. SSD
3. Intel i7-9750H processor
4. RTX 2060 Graphics card
5. Fingerprint sensor

### Shortlisted Laptops

The main youtube channels which I rely for laptop reviews are,

- [Dave Lee (Dave 2D)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVYamHliCI9rw1tHR1xbkfw)
- [OWNorDisown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkTweJExGMqp3NLvzvOn-yg)
- [Matthew Moniz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVlMUh4WsDQvOxCJJXmWwdw)
- [Jarrod'sTech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Rzju32yQPkQ7oIhmeuLwg)
- [Bob Of All Trades](https://www.youtube.com/user/satanjamez)

And After watching tons of reviews and all, my shortlisted items are,

#### Acer Predator Triton 500

##### Pros

Waiting for the new model to release with updated hardware including 9th generation Intel CPU's.

Its the cheapest in my list.

##### Cons

### Skipped Laptops

#### Lenovo Y740

- Big Charger and small battery.

#### Asus ROG Zephyrus s GX701

- Lack of thunderbolt support.

### Conclusion

This is not the end of this post. Consider it as a draft for now. I will update my thoughts on the non-available machines once they are released.
