Content and issue management for https://www.abhith.net

I use VSO (Visual Studio Online) as my version control for the website hosted in https://www.abhith.net. Recently one of my collegue said some suggestions and some corrections need to be done in the website. Then I thought of why don't collaborate with them if they willing to help. So I created this repository and will add/update the content here as md so that they can submit a PR if they are that much kindful.

If you have any suggestion, create an issue or give me a PR.
Good things always get appreciated, am a very nice guy. :)
