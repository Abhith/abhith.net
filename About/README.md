About Myself
### Description
I’m an experienced software engineer, had built and maintained web applications for a large user base. A passionate coder always thriving to explore the new aspects of technology. Am on the trail and always ready to ride and code. Picking up a new framework or language isn’t a big constraint for me, rather I consider it’s a challenge like riding a bike through the muddy roads.

Working professionally in the software development field for the past 5 years, I have a diverse set of skills ranging from ASP.NET, C#, Linq, SQL, WEBAPI, SignalR, AngularJS, Ionic, Xamarin Forms, JavaScript, VueJS, VB.NET, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, SEO and more. I have got some tightly honed skills in .NET and constantly looking for ways to improve.

### Story
I started my career at Aabasoft where I was joined as an intern after my B-Tech. There I learned HTML, CSS and basic Javascript concepts, then moved onto C#, MSSQL. After my internship, they offered me a job and I took it.

They assigned me to one of their biggest ERP project for a client having 3000+ branches. For that project, I have to self-learn VB.NET and I did. Then I lead the FOREX part in the job as well as some other area.

One challenge they gave me was to generate a salary report for the HR part of the project, where they want to generate a salary for all the employees in their 3000+ branches in a single click. The next day, after setting my skype status to "Do Not Disturb", I wrote a stored procedure with 1.5k+ lines of query. It had so much math in it. And it worked well and I was very proud of it. Every time I saw that SQL query later, my inner mind told, "hmm, I could have made this query little bit short". I think this is normal for every developer when they saw their old work, they know they can make a better version of it now.

This story will continue...
