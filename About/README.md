About Myself
### Description
I’m an experienced software engineer, had built and maintained web applications for a large user base. A passionate coder always thriving to explore the new aspects of technology. Am on the trail and always ready to ride and code. Picking up a new framework or language isn’t a big constraint for me, rather I consider it’s a challenge like riding a bike through the muddy roads.

Working professionally in the software development field for the past 5 years, I have a diverse set of skills ranging from ASP.NET, C#, Linq, SQL, WEBAPI, SignalR, AngularJS, Ionic, Xamarin Forms, JavaScript, VueJS, VB.NET, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, SEO and more. I have got some tightly honed skills in .NET and constantly looking for ways to improve.
